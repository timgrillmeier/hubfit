|---|---|---|---|
|`master`|This is your 'good' copy or official release history. Only used to deploy code.|||
|`develop`|This branch is used for merging feature branches and testing. Don't develop directly on this branch.|`master`|`release/...`|
|`feature/...`|Each new feature or component should have it's own branch.|`develop`|`develop`|

### Developing locally with Lando

**Start and stop Lando:**

`lando start` and `lando stop`

**Import/export an existing database:**

`lando db-import database.sql` or `lando db-export database.sql`

**Search and replace strings in the database:**

`lando wp search-replace 'https://oldurl.com' 'https://newurl.com'`

**Access WP CLI**

`lando wp [command]`

### Building Scripts and Styles

#### Setup

The `init.sh` script will perform much of the initial Sage setup but on subsequent pulls, particularly when working with other developers, it may be necessary to run yarn and composer again to pull in any new dependencies. 

```
cd wp-content/themes/mytheme/
composer install 
yarn
yarn build
```

#### Commands

Use the appropriate commands:

`yarn start`            - Watches code, lints and builds on the fly. Includes browser sync and live reloading.

`yarn lint`             - Manually lints your work.

`yarn build`            - Builds static assets. Suitable for development and staging environments.

`yarn build:product`    - Builds production ready assets. Minifies files, compresses images and removes console logs etc.
